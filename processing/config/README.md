Directory to define configuration that will be used. Specifically, here you should create a txt file (passed as a string) where the pseudorapidity and momentum bins are defined.

The file should be created as:

```
eta1 eta2 eta3 ... \
p1 p2 p3 ...
```

where the first line, which should end in \, contains space-separated eta bin limits, and the second line contains momentum bin limits.
See the file example.txt
